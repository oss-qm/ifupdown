ifupdown (0.7~rc1+experimental) experimental; urgency=low

    If ifup or ifquery is called with the --all option, if doesn't just
    bring up all interfaces marked as "auto", but all interfaces of a
    specified class, 'auto' by default. For the most uses, this doesn't
    change anything, but lets all the interfaces of a specific class to be
    brought up or queried.

    If ifupdown is called with the --all option, before or after doing
    anything to the interfaces, it calls all the hook scripts (pre-up or
    down) with IFACE set to "--all", LOGICAL set to the current class
    specified by the --allow option (or "auto" if it's not set),
    ADDRFAM="meta" and METHOD="none".
