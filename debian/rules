# BUILD NOTES
#
# ifupdown's written in litprog using noweb. noweb is written in icon.
# icon isn't as portable as one might hope (it needs to have bits recoded
# for each arch and OS it's ported to. ugh).
#
# So. The "upstream" source is made to not include any of the generated
# files. That's neat and tidy. If you want to modify anything, you edit
# the .nw file.
#
# Once you've done all the Debian changes, you run debian/rules binary,
# and get all the .c files and such updated. Once you're done, you
# run debian/rules clean, which leaves the generated .c files around
# for porters. You then generate a .diff.gz, and all should be well.
#
# Useful targets of the toplevel makefile:
# clobber:
#   * gets rid of all the generated files except Makefile,
#     make{c,nw}dep.sh, which are needed to bootstrap
#
# distclean:
#   * removes ALL generated files.  Use with care.
#
# docs: 
#   * builds the documentation. Note that this is not done per
#     default (only executables are built). If this is added to
#     the default build process (which will not be done in the near
#     future since dia requires an X display even if using the -e option) 
#     the 'tetex-base' and 'dia' packages would need to be added to the
#     Build-Dep
