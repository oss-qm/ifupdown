Migrating /etc/network/run to a different place
===============================================

In the latest ifupdown, the ifupdown state is stored by default in 
/lib/init/rw/network, and /etc/network/run is set up to be a symlink 
to that location. That was made because the default location is 
sometimes read-only, and /dev/shm isn't a right place for it too.

The migration isn't done by default, though; if you want to perform it, 
you have to do this either manually, or use a helper script
/usr/share/ifupdown/move-network-run.
